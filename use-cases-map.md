# Context Binding Platform — Use Cases Map

> A comprehensive map of user scenarios the platform needs to support.
> Each use case represents a distinct user intent — what they want to achieve, which platform capabilities are involved, and what the prototype status is.

---

## How to read this

Each use case follows this structure:
- **Number** — sequential ID
- **User intent** — what the user is trying to do (in their words)
- **Tags** — which platform capabilities/areas are involved
- **Status** — `✅ Prototyped` | `🔶 Partially` | `⬜ Not started`

### Out of Scope (This Phase)

- **DB Drivers** — Backend data connectivity layer. Mentioned in the high-level overview but not part of the current context binding product scope. Will be addressed in a future phase.

---

### Key Takeaway

**59 out of 166 use cases are prototyped (~36%), with 19 partially done.**

Entire untouched areas:
- **N — Write Mode & Forms** (7 use cases) — data collection, form submission, input validation, update records
- **O — Custom Components & Dev** (5 use cases) — custom components with binding, Velo contexts, AI wiring
- **M — Design Variants** (4 use cases) — conditional styling, variant switching, layout states
- **P — CMS-Specific** (2 use cases) — inline field creation, usage overview

Critical areas with significant remaining work:
- **G — UoU Interactions** (0/13 done, 2 partial) — search, sort, pagination, infinite scroll, empty states, loading, conditional filtering
- **C — Repeater & List Renderers** (4/21 done) — Gallery, Table, Accordion, Tabs, Slideshow, Maps, nested repeaters, presets
- **J — Scope & Lifecycle** (1/10) — promote, lightbox, missing context guidance, system contexts
- **I — Dynamic Pages** (5/10) — URL binding, page variants, app dynamic pages
- **F — Functions & Actions** (4/11) — event handlers, action chaining, OOTB libraries, conflict resolution
